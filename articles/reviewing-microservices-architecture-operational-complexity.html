<h3>Spring Cloud Config</h3>
<h4>It handles the management of the application configuration data through a centralized service</h4>
<h4>This ensures that no matter how many microservice instances you bring up, they will always have the same configuration.</h4>
<h3>Spring Cloud Service Discovery</h3>
<h4>You can abstract away the physical location (IP and/or server name) of where your servers are deployed from the clients consuming the service.</h4>
<h4>It also handles the registration and deregistration of service instances as these are started and shut down.</h4>
<p>Service Registration - How a service registers with the service discovery agent</p>
<p>Client lookup of service address - How a service client looks up service information</p>
<p>Information sharing - How nodes share service information</p>
<p>Health monitoring - How services communicate their health back to the service discovery agent</p>
<h3>Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and Resilience4j</h3>
<h4>Resilience4j - It is a fault tolerance library which offers the following patterns for increasing fault tolerance due to network problems or failure of any of our multiple services</h4>
<p>Circuit breaker - Stops making requests when an invoked service is failing</p>
<p>Retry - Retries service when it temporarily fails</p>
<p>Bulkhead - Limits the number of outgoing concurrent service requests to avoid overload</p>
<p>Rate limit - Limits the number of calls that a service receives at a time</p>
<p>Fallback - Sets alternative paths for failing requests</p>
<h3>Spring Cloud Gateway</h3>
<h4>Mapping the routes for all the services in your application to a single URL</h4>
<h4>Building filters that can inspect and act on the requests and responses coming through the gateway</h4>
<h4>Building prediccates, which are objects that allow us to check if the requests fulfill a set of given conditions before executing or processing a requests</h4>
<h4>It is a reverse proxy. A reverse proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client trying to reach a resource and the resource itself. The client has no idea it&#x27;s even communicating with a server. The reverse proxy takes care of capturing the client&#x27;s request andthen calls the remote resource on the client&#x27;s behalf.</h4></section></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"title":"Reviewing the Microservices Architecture with Spring","date":"2020-05-02","desciption":"Taking Notes while trying to understand how to build and operationalize microservice-based applications","tags":"Backend, Spring, Java","thumbnail":"/img/some-thumbnail.png","content":"\n## Spring Cloud\n\n### Spring Cloud Config\n\n#### It handles the management of the application configuration data through a centralized service\n\n#### This ensures that no matter how many microservice instances you bring up, they will always have the same configuration.\n\n### Spring Cloud Service Discovery\n\n#### You can abstract away the physical location (IP and/or server name) of where your servers are deployed from the clients consuming the service.\n\n#### It also handles the registration and deregistration of service instances as these are started and shut down.\n\nService Registration - How a service registers with the service discovery agent\n\nClient lookup of service address - How a service client looks up service information\n\nInformation sharing - How nodes share service information\n\nHealth monitoring - How services communicate their health back to the service discovery agent\n\n### Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and Resilience4j\n\n#### Resilience4j - It is a fault tolerance library which offers the following patterns for increasing fault tolerance due to network problems or failure of any of our multiple services\n\nCircuit breaker - Stops making requests when an invoked service is failing\n\nRetry - Retries service when it temporarily fails\n\nBulkhead - Limits the number of outgoing concurrent service requests to avoid overload\n\nRate limit - Limits the number of calls that a service receives at a time\n\nFallback - Sets alternative paths for failing requests\n\n### Spring Cloud Gateway\n\n#### Mapping the routes for all the services in your application to a single URL\n\n#### Building filters that can inspect and act on the requests and responses coming through the gateway\n\n#### Building prediccates, which are objects that allow us to check if the requests fulfill a set of given conditions before executing or processing a requests\n\n#### It is a reverse proxy.

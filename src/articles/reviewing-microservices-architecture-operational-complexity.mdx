### Spring Cloud

#### Spring Cloud Config

##### It handles the management of the application configuration data through a centralized service

##### This ensures that no matter how many microservice instances you bring up, they will always have the same configuration.

##### It provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system.

#### Spring Cloud Service Discovery

##### A service registry is useful because it enables client-side load-balancing and decouples service providers from consumers without the need for DNS.

##### You can abstract away the physical location (IP and/or server name) of where your servers are deployed from the clients consuming the service.

##### It also handles the registration and deregistration of service instances as these are started and shut down.

- **Service Registration** - How a service registers with the service discovery agent

- **Client lookup of service address** - How a service client looks up service information

- **Information sharing** - How nodes share service information

- **Health monitoring** - How services communicate their health back to the service discovery agent

#### Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and Resilience4j

##### Spring Cloud LoadBalancer library - It allows us to create applications that communicate with other applications in a load-balanced fashion. Using any algorithm we want, we can easily implement load balancing when making remote service calls

##### Resilience4j - It is a fault tolerance library which offers the following patterns for increasing fault tolerance due to network problems or failure of any of our multiple services

- **Circuit breaker** - Stops making requests when an invoked service is failing

- **Retry** - Retries service when it temporarily fails

- **Bulkhead** - Limits the number of outgoing concurrent service requests to avoid overload

- **Rate limit** - Limits the number of calls that a service receives at a time

- **Fallback** - Sets alternative paths for failing requests

#### Spring Cloud Gateway

##### Mapping the routes for all the services in your application to a single URL

##### Building filters that can inspect and act on the requests and responses coming through the gateway

##### Building prediccates, which are objects that allow us to check if the requests fulfill a set of given conditions before executing or processing a requests

##### It is a reverse proxy. A reverse proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client trying to reach a resource and the resource itself. The client has no idea it's even communicating with a server. The reverse proxy takes care of capturing the client's request andthen calls the remote resource on the client's behalf.
